# BTMaddpg

## Scenarios
The folder mpe contains the openai's multi-particle environment. In mpe/multiagent/scenarios there are the different scenarios used to train the agents.

## Training
To start training, one should run train.py which is inside maddpg/xperiments. The only necessary parameter is --scenario "scenario-name".

## Requirements
The requirements are specified in the various requirements.txt or simply run the code and see what it's asked. Tensorflow 1.x is required, tensorflow==1.14.0 works just fine.
